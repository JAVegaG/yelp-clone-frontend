# Yelp Clone Frontend

This app is a Yelp clone created using React based on the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://youtu.be/J01rYl9T3BU). This repository mainly addresses the frontend, while the backend can be seen [here](https://github.com/JAVegaG/yelp-clone-backend/actions).

This client-side part of the application communicates with the backend through its API to create, read, update or delete information according to the client's needs.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
